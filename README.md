# Everstore
-- A digital store for the Evercade and Evercade VS. --

Everstore is a fully functional, easy-to-use, and FREE digital store for the Evercade family of consoles scripted in Go and CSS.

Build Info:

------------------------------------------------------
- 0.0.1: No functionality! Just started development.
- 1.0.0 (unreleased): Real UI, and some games for download!
------------------------------------------------------

Set features: Game/app uploads, game/app backups for full titles and save data, and some games for download to get the store started! No apps yet, I need some homebrew apps for the store. Open an issue if you have a homebrew app I can use.
quantumgames is helping with this project, he will have his own branch.

Sorry I havent been developing, I've been checking out new things, working on Left 2 Die, and being an admin on the EaglerCraft server Quantumcraft.

----------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE! Everstore is homebrew software. Installing it may have an *insanely slim* chance of bricking your Evercade or Evercade VS! Also, Everstore is not installable until Everbrew (the custom firmware required to run Homebrew) is released. Everstore does not charge money, all software hosted in the Everstore is free. If your version of Everstore prompts you to pay money, you have installed a fake version of Everstore. These versions can scam you, and unless people ask me for permission to make a new version, aren't authorised for rerelease. I am not responsible if you brick your Evercade if you install Everbrew OR the Everstore. Pirated software will be removed from the store if added.
