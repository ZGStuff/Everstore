# Everstore
-- A digital store for the Evercade and Evercade VS. --

Everstore is a fully functional, easy-to-use, and FREE digital store for the Evercade family of consoles scripted in Go and CSS.

Build Info:

------------------------------------------------------
- 0.0.1: No functionality! Just started development.
- 1.0.0 (unreleased): Real UI, and some games for download!
------------------------------------------------------

Set features: Game/app uploads, game/app backups for full titles and save data, and some games for download to get the store started! No apps yet, I need some homebrew apps for the store. Open an issue if you have a homebrew app I can use.
